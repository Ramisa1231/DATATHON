# DATATHON
This is a code that I wrote for the **_18-hour-long_ DataTHON** Organized by the **Society of Quantitative Analysis and Data _SQUAD_** @The University of Adelaide.
The code takes a set of features as input to predict a binary output. This is a classification problem with imbalanced data set
